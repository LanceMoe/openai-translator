## Local Development

### 1. Install pnpm

Make sure that pnpm is installed on your computer. If it's not already installed, you can install it:

https://pnpm.io/installation

### 2. Download project dependencies

Navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following command to download project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the local server

Run the following command to start the local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Open the application

Vite should automatically open your browser.

## Build the Project

### Docker Build

#### 1. Run docker build

Navigate to the root directory of your project in your command line interface and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t openai-translator-web .
```

Here, `openai-translator-web` is the name you want to give to the image, and the `.` at the end indicates the current directory.

#### 2. Start the Container

Run the following command to start the container and map the port to your local machine:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 openai-translator-web
```

Here, 3000 represents the local port you want to map to the container's 80 port. You can change this to any other port you prefer.

#### 3. Open the Application

In your browser, enter the following URL to access the application:

http://localhost:3000/

### Local Build

#### 1. Install pnpm

Make sure that pnpm is installed on your computer. If it's not already installed, you can install it:

https://pnpm.io/installation

#### 2. Download project dependencies

Navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following command to download project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Build

Run the following command to build your project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The compiled files will be placed in the `dist` folder.

#### 4. Deploy

Now you can treat the files in the `dist` folder as a static website and deploy it on the server.
